- [x] After bookmarking search results and escaping back to main view, those bookmarked packages should be in the list (uninstalled of course)
- [x] Why does "Loading..." take so dang long, like 5 seconds??
- [x] The Packages list is nice and fast now, but the "Search Results" list still takes a very very long to show.
- [x] Bug: The scrolling is misbehaving. When I move the cursor up at the top edge so that the whole list should scroll, only the top 2 list items scroll, and the rest stay the same. The rest (which stayed the same) update after pushing down arrow. This only happens sometimes, which make sit even more mysterious.
- [x] Bug: When the package list (either main list or search results) has more items than can fit on the screen, the title bar ("Boxy [brew]") doesn't show 
- [x] Better loading: on search, instead of clearing the whole screen and showing just "Loading", show the search results screen, but where the list items would appear, put some loading animation
- [x] Better loading: when I hit enter to see item details, there's no indication that anything is happening until the response comes back. Instead, can we open the overlay box right away, with a loading animation until the info replaces it?
- [ ] Install function in apt (linux) seems not to work, probably a sudo problem
- [ ] brew list has a `--installed-on-request` flag, which we could use to filter out packages installed indirectly as dependencies. Does apt have this too?
- [ ] Support install scripts as packages (`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`)
- [ ] Should we add a fzf-style search of local packages? ("local" means installed or bookmarked)
- [ ] Should we combine packages from all installed package managers in the same list? In that case, we'd want each item to have an icon or something representing the package manager.
- [ ] Add compatibility with other package managers: Arch
